# MeshCore Node Manager

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/2E0LXY/meshcore-node-manager?style=flat-square&color=89b4fa&label=release)](https://github.com/2E0LXY/meshcore-node-manager/releases/latest) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-MIT-a6e3a1?style=flat-square)](LICENSE) [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10%2B-cba6f7?style=flat-square)](https://python.org)

A desktop app for **Windows, macOS and Linux** that lets you send and receive
text messages across a **LoRa mesh radio network** using MeshCore-flashed
hardware such as the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 / V4.

Connect your radio node by **USB cable**, **WiFi**, or **Bluetooth**, then:

- Chat on the public channel or send private direct messages with delivery confirmation
- See every node on your mesh — signal strength, GPS position, battery level
- Track message delivery, round-trip times, and network statistics
- View node locations plotted on a live map
- Get desktop and sound alerts when messages arrive

**No cloud. No internet required.** All traffic travels over LoRa radio.
Range is typically **2–15 km line of sight** depending on hardware and antenna.

> **Licence:** MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE)
> **Python:** 3.10 or later required

**Design principles**

- `NodeRadio` never calls GUI code directly. All device events flow outward
  through `EventBus.emit()`.
- All tabs subscribe to bus events and update themselves via `after_tk()`,
  which marshals every UI update onto the Tkinter main thread.
- `NodeRadio` runs a background `asyncio` event loop in a daemon thread.
  All device I/O is async; all public methods are thread-safe.
- Shared state (`_contacts`, `_history`, `_pending`) is protected by
  `threading.Lock` objects so the GUI thread and the async loop never race.

## Recommended firmware

For **Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3** and **V4**, use the dt267 low-power fork:

**[https://github.com/dt267/MeshCore-Low-Power-Firmware-For-Heltec-V3-V4](https://github.com/dt267/MeshCore-Low-Power-Firmware-For-Heltec-V3-V4)**

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| Transports | USB serial + BLE + TCP/WiFi simultaneously in one binary |
| Hardware | V3, WSL3, V4 (V4.2 / V4.3 with KCT8103L FEM, auto-detected) |
| Display | OLED vs no-display auto-detected at boot — no separate build needed |
| OTA updates | Send `start ota` in the `TerminalCLI` channel |
| Low-battery protection | Deep sleep at 3.4 V; wake at 3.5 V |
| Adaptive RX gain | Tracks ambient noise floor |
| GPS power management | On only during fix acquisition (V4.2) |
| Battery life (idle) | V3 ≈ 7 days; V4 ≈ 3.5 days on 2 000 mAh |

> **V4 requirement:** official MeshCore firmware **v1.15.0+** is required for
> the V4 hardware generation.

> **Serial idle note:** the dt267 firmware deactivates the serial port after
> **30 seconds of idle**. Use TCP for a persistent desktop connection, or
> click **📡 Ping** to wake a dormant serial link.

> **V4.2 RX sensitivity:** if you notice poor receive sensitivity or a high
> noise floor on V4.2, a hardware mod to bypass the external LNA is
> documented in the firmware repository (`Bypass-External-LNA-on-Heltec-V4.md`).

Also compatible with **meshcomod** (ALLFATHER-BV) which provides the same
USB + BLE + TCP multi-transport support:
[https://github.com/ALLFATHER-BV/meshcomod](https://github.com/ALLFATHER-BV/meshcomod)

---

## Installation

### Option A — clone from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2E0LXY/meshcore-node-manager.git
cd meshcore-node-manager
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Option B — virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2E0LXY/meshcore-node-manager.git
cd meshcore-node-manager

# Create and activate
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Option C — Windows one-liner (in the repo directory)

```bat
python -m venv venv && venv\Scripts\activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py
```

---

## Quick start

1. Flash your Heltec V3 / V4 with dt267 firmware (see
   [recommended firmware](#recommended-firmware))
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python main.py`
4. Click **🔵 BLE** → **🔍 Scan (5 s)** → double-click your node (green row)
5. The **📡 Contacts** tab populates; the **💬 Channel** tab shows live traffic

---

## Connecting to a node

### 🔵 BLE (Bluetooth)

1. Click **🔵 BLE** in the toolbar
2. Click **🔍 Scan (5 s)** — MeshCore nodes appear in **green** at the top
3. **Double-click** a row to connect instantly, or select a row and click
   **✅ Connect**
4. You can also type a MAC address or partial device name directly in the
   address field and click **✅ Connect** without scanning

**Tips:**
- If no devices appear, confirm Bluetooth is enabled on your computer and
  the node is powered on
- On Linux, run `bluetoothctl power on` before scanning

### 🌐 TCP / WiFi

1. Click **🌐 TCP**
2. Enter the node's **IP address** (check your router's DHCP table or the
   node's OLED display)
3. Port defaults to **4403** — change only if your node is configured
   differently

TCP is the most reliable transport for desktop use: it has no idle timeout
and works over a LAN or port-forwarded internet connection.

### LoRaHAM companion TCP

When using `meshcore-pi` with the LoRaHAM daemon, connect to the companion
TCP server:

1. Start the LoRaHAM daemon and the `meshcore-pi` LoRaHAM companion
2. Click **🌐 TCP**
3. Host: `127.0.0.1`
4. Port: `5000`

Click **📣 Advert** once if another MeshCore node does not yet know this node.
For unattended use, enable **⚙ Settings → Connection → Auto-advert**.

### 🔌 Serial (USB)

1. Connect the node with a **USB-C data cable** (not a charge-only cable)
2. Click **🔌 Serial**
3. Enter the COM port:
   - Windows: `COM3`, `COM4` … (check Device Manager → Ports)
   - Linux: `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`
   - macOS: `/dev/cu.usbserial-*`
4. Press Enter or click OK

**Linux permission fix** (one-time):
```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
# then log out and back in
```

**Serial idle timeout:** the dt267 firmware disconnects serial after 30 s
idle. Click **📡 Ping** to re-establish, or switch to TCP for persistent
sessions.

---

## Tabs in detail

### 📡 Contacts

Displays all contacts known to the connected node, sorted by name.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | Advertised name of the contact |
| Key | First 16 hex characters of the public key (unique ID) |
| SNR | Signal-to-noise ratio of the last received packet (dB) |
| RSSI | Received signal strength of the last packet (dBm) |
| Batt % | Battery level if the contact device reports it |
| Last Heard | Time of the last received packet from this contact |
| GPS | Latitude / longitude if the contact broadcasts position |

**Row colours:**
- **Green** — contact was heard within the last 10 minutes
- **Dimmed** — older than 10 minutes or never heard

**Filter:** type in the filter box to search by name or key; the count label
updates live.

**Sort:** click any column heading to sort ascending; click again to reverse.

**🔄 Refresh:** reloads the full contact list from the device.

**🗑 Remove:** removes the selected contact(s) from the **local cache only**.
The device's own contact list is not affected; contacts reappear on the next
Refresh.

---

### 💬 Channel

Broadcast messages on the public LoRa channel. All nodes within RF range
receive these messages.

- **Sent** messages appear in **blue**
- **Received** messages appear in **green**
- **Live character counter** — LoRa maximum is **228 characters** per frame;
  a warning dialog appears if you try to send more
- Press **Enter** or click **📤 Broadcast** to send

> **No ACK for broadcasts** — the MeshCore protocol does not provide delivery
> confirmation for channel messages. Use Direct messages if you need ACK.

> **Broadcast API note:** the `send_msg(None, text)` call used for broadcasting
> is supported on dt267 v1.13+ and meshcomod firmware. If you see
> *"Broadcast failed"* in the Log tab, upgrade your firmware.

---

### 📨 Direct

Private direct messages to a specific contact with delivery tracking.

- The **To:** dropdown auto-populates with known contact names after
  connecting; start typing to filter the list
- You can also type a pubkey prefix directly if the contact does not appear
  by name
- Press **Enter** or click **📨 Send DM** to send
- **Live character counter** — same 228-character limit as Channel
- After each sent DM, an inline note appears when:
  - **✅ Delivered (RTT x.xs)** — ACK received with round-trip time
  - **⏱ Timeout — no ACK received** — 30 seconds elapsed with no response

**ACK tracking works when:**
- The destination node is within LoRa RF range
- The destination is running MeshCore companion firmware
- The message type is direct (not a broadcast)

**Received** DMs appear in **green**; sent messages appear in **blue**.

---

### 📊 History

Full record of all sent and received messages.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Dir | ↑ = sent, ↓ = received |
| Type | `channel` or `direct` |
| Peer | Destination (↑) or sender (↓) |
| Message | First 34 characters of the message text |
| Status | `pending` / `sent` / `delivered` / `timeout` / `received` |
| Time | Timestamp when sent or received |
| RTT | Round-trip time in seconds for delivered DMs |

**Row colours:**
- **Green** — delivered or received
- **Red** — timeout
- **Blue/cyan** — pending ACK

**Stats bar** at the top shows:
- Total messages, sent (↑), received (↓)
- Delivered, timeout, pending counts
- Average RTT across all delivered DMs
- Success percentage (delivered / total sent × 100)

**🗑 Clear History** removes all messages from the in-memory store only.
It does not affect the device.

---

### 📻 Radio

Radio configuration read from the device at connect time, plus live
device statistics.

**Radio Parameters (read-only):**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Frequency (MHz) | LoRa carrier frequency |
| Bandwidth (kHz) | LoRa signal bandwidth |
| Spreading Factor | SF7 – SF12 |
| Coding Rate | LoRa forward error correction ratio |
| TX Power (dBm) | Transmit power level |

**Live Device Stats:** click **🔄 Refresh** to fetch real-time counters
(TX packets, RX packets, error counts, etc.) from the device.

> **Write-back not available.** The MeshCore Python companion API does not
> expose a writable configuration tree. To change radio parameters, use:
> - The **device button UI** (navigate the OLED menu)
> - The **TerminalCLI channel**: create a channel named `TerminalCLI` on the
>   device, then type commands in the Channel tab
>
> Live stats require dt267 v1.13+ or meshcomod firmware with stats support.

---

### 📋 Log

Colour-coded application log showing every event.

| Colour | Level | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Green** | `ok` | Connected, ACK confirmed, backup saved, ping OK |
| **Yellow** | `warn` | ACK timeout, disconnect warning, contact not found |
| **Red** | `err` | Connection failed, send failed, library missing |
| **Cyan** | `info` | Message sent, disconnecting, history cleared |
| **Grey** | `debug` | Verbose internal events |

**🗑 Clear** wipes the log display (application continues running normally).

**💾 Save** opens a file dialog and saves the full log to a `.txt` file.

---

## Bridge Network

Connect geographically separate MeshCore networks over the internet so that
channel messages and contact telemetry flow between them automatically.
**Disabled by default.**

### ⟷ Bridge tab

Shows whether the bridge is running and lists all currently connected peers.
Remote contacts appear prefixed with ⟷ in the Contacts and Map tabs.
Bridged channel messages are prefixed with `[ORIGIN-NODE]`.

Direct messages (DMs) are **never bridged** — they remain private.

### Setting up peer-to-peer (two locations)

See the full guide in [§ Bridge Network](#bridge-network) of the
[User Manual](docs/USER_MANUAL.md).

### Setting up with the hub (recommended — no port-forwarding)

See **[hub/README.md](hub/README.md)** for the 5-minute server setup guide.

Once the hub is running at `wss://yourdomain.com/hub`, each Node Manager
instance just needs:

1. ⚙ Settings → Bridge Network → tick **Enable bridge**
2. Peers box: `wss://yourdomain.com/hub`
3. Enter shared secret → 💾 Save

---

## Firmware limitations

The MeshCore Python companion API exposes a subset of device functionality.
The following are **not available** through this application:

| Feature | Reason |
|---|---|
| WiFi / MQTT / LoRa config write-back | No writable config tree in API |
| Channel name / uplink / downlink edit | Not exposed by API |
| Node role, region, modem preset | Not exposed by API |
| `setOwner` (rename the node) | Not exposed by API |
| GPS configuration | Not exposed by API |

**Workaround for all of the above:** use the device button UI (OLED menu)
or the `TerminalCLI` channel. Create a channel named exactly `TerminalCLI`
on the device, then type commands in the **💬 Channel** tab.

**Broadcast API:** `send_msg(None, text)` is the broadcast call used by this
application. It works on dt267 v1.13+ and meshcomod firmware. If you see
*"Broadcast failed"* in the Log tab, upgrade your firmware to dt267 v1.13+.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: meshcore` | `pip install meshcore` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: bleak` | `pip install bleak` |
| BLE scan finds no devices | Confirm Bluetooth is enabled; on Linux run `bluetoothctl power on` |
| BLE scan finds device but connection fails | Some adapters require a prior OS-level pair; use `bluetoothctl pair <addr>` on Linux |
| Serial "Permission denied" on Linux | `sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER` then log out and back in |
| Serial disconnects after ~30 s | dt267 serial idle timeout; click **📡 Ping** or switch to TCP |
| "Contact not found" when sending DM | Click **🔄 Contacts** to refresh; check name spelling (case-insensitive) |
| Other node cannot DM this node | Click **📣 Advert** once so it can learn this node |
| "Broadcast failed — firmware may not support…" | Upgrade to dt267 v1.13+ or meshcomod |
| Live stats show no data | Requires dt267 v1.13+ or meshcomod with stats support |
| Black screen on V4 after flashing | Flash the non-merged `.bin` at offset `0x10000` if the device already has a valid bootloader |
| App hangs when clicking Serial or TCP | Ensure Python 3.10+; if on Windows try running as administrator once to rule out COM port permissions |
| History tab doesn't update after sending | Ensure `EV_MSG_SENT` is received — check the Log tab for any send errors |

### Module responsibilities

**`main.py`** (8 lines) — creates `AppWindow` and calls `mainloop()`.

**`config.py`** — all tuneable constants in one place:
- `TCP_DEFAULT_PORT = 4403`
- `ACK_TIMEOUT_SECS = 30`
- `HISTORY_LIMIT = 500`
- `LORA_MAX_CHARS = 228`
- Full Catppuccin Mocha colour palette (`TH` dict) and semantic aliases (`C` dict)
- Log level → colour mapping (`LOG_COLOURS` dict)

**`helpers.py`** — six pure functions with no side effects:
- `ts_to_hms(epoch)` — UNIX timestamp → `"HH:MM:SS"` or `"—"`
- `ts_to_iso(epoch)` — UNIX timestamp → `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` or `"—"`
- `pubkey_short(raw)` — bytes/str → first 16 hex chars
- `safe_str(value)` — None-safe string conversion with fallback
- `fmt_rtt(seconds)` — float → `"1.4s"` or `""`
- `normalise_key(raw)` — lowercase stripped string for case-insensitive matching

**`events.py`** — `EventBus` class with `on()`, `off()`, `emit()`, `clear()`.
Ten well-known event constants (`EV_CONNECTED`, `EV_MSG_DIRECT`, etc.).
The bus is the only communication channel between `NodeRadio` and the GUI.

**`radio.py`** — `NodeRadio` class. `Contact` and `Message` dataclasses.
Public methods: `connect_serial()`, `connect_tcp()`, `connect_ble()`,
`disconnect()`, `ping()`, `scan_ble()`, `refresh_contacts()`,
`get_contacts()`, `get_contact_names()`, `remove_contact()`,
`transmit_channel()`, `transmit_direct()`, `sweep_timeouts()`,
`message_history()`, `message_stats()`, `clear_history()`,
`export_messages()`, `save_backup()`, `load_backup()`, `live_stats()`,
`radio_params()`.

**`app.py`** — `AppWindow` (Tk root), `TabBase`, six tab classes, two dialogs
(`_PromptDialog`, `_BLEDialog`). No business logic; only layout and event
wiring.

### Originality statement

This project is an **original, independent work**. It was written from
scratch with no copying or derivation from any prior codebase.

In particular, it is **not** a port, fork, modification, or derivative of
[Meshtastic-Ultimate-Center-ACH](https://github.com/Piccolino1965/Meshtastic-Ultimate-Center-ACH)
by Giovanni Popolizio, which is published under a custom all-rights-reserved
licence that prohibits redistribution and sharing in any form. That licence
was carefully reviewed and is fully respected: no code, structure, logic, or
creative expression from that project has been used here.

The shared domain — a Python/Tkinter desktop app for managing a LoRa mesh
radio node — naturally leads to common technical vocabulary
(`connect_serial`, `connect_tcp`, `_build_toolbar`) and similar functional
requirements (contacts list, channel messaging, DM with ACK). These
overlaps fall under the legal doctrine of *scènes à faire*: elements that
are standard, stock, or necessary to a given domain are not protectable by
copyright. All shared identifiers were independently arrived at; none were
copied.

The architecture of this project — `EventBus`, `NodeRadio`, `TabBase`,
typed `Contact` / `Message` dataclasses, and the pub/sub event flow — has
no equivalent in the referenced project and represents original creative
choices.
